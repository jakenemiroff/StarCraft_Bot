# StarCraft Bot

This project integrates with Blizzard's Starcraft API using python, in order to build some fun bots!

I'll be trying to recreate some fun (and annoying) builds/strategies, and testing them against the games built in AI opponent on various levels of difficulty.

## In order to Run:

pip install sc2
